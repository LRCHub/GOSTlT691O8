[00:03.03] I've felt the air rise up in me
[00:06.03] Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
[00:08.78] I wander out where you can't see
[00:10.55] Inside my shell I wait and bleed
[00:26.55] 
[00:13.39] I've felt the air rise up in me
[00:16.05] Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
[00:18.89] I wander out where you can't see
[00:21.57] Inside my shell I wait and bleed
[00:37.57] 
[00:28.88] Goodbye!
[00:32.88] 
[00:29.78] I wipe it off the tile, the light is brighter this time
[00:30.60] Everything is 3-D blasphemy, my eyes are red and gold
[00:35.24] The hair is standing straight up, this is not the way I pictured me
[00:38.98] I can't control my shakes, how the hell did I get here?
[00:42.66] Something about this, so very wrong, I have to laugh out loud
[00:45.56] I wish I didn't like this, is it a dream or a memory?
[01:12.06] 
[00:50.21] I've felt the air rise up in me
[00:52.04] Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
[00:54.82] I wander out where you can't see
[00:57.57] Inside my shell I wait and bleed
[01:13.57] 
[01:03.01] Get outta my head 'cause I don't need this
[01:04.85] Why didn't I see this?
[01:06.68] Well I'm a victim, Manchurian Candidate
[01:08.53] I have sinned by just makin' my mind up
[01:12.30] And takin' your breath away
[01:25.80] 
[01:14.95] I've felt the air rise up in me
[01:16.87] Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
[01:19.61] I wander out where you can't see
[01:21.48] Inside my shell I wait and bleed
[01:37.48] 
[01:24.27] I've felt the air rise up in me
[01:26.09] Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
[01:28.91] I wander out where you can't see
[01:31.60] Inside my shell I wait and bleed
[01:47.60] 
[01:34.32] Goodbye!
[01:38.32] 
[01:39.09] You haven't learned a thing, I haven't changed a thing
[01:47.16] The flesh was in my bones, the pain is always free
[01:48.02] You haven't learned a thing, I haven't changed a thing
[01:50.83] The flesh was in my bones, the pain is always free
[02:15.83] 
[01:54.55] I've felt the air rise up in me
[01:56.30] Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
[01:58.21] I wander out where you can't see
[02:00.94] Inside my shell I wait and bleed
[02:16.94] 
[02:03.70] I've felt the air rise up in me
[02:05.54] Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
[02:08.32] I wander out where you can't see
[02:10.17] Inside my shell I wait and bleed
[02:26.17] 
[02:29.41] And it waits for you
